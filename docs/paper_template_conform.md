ABSTRACT

We present PEN-T, an extensible penetration testing framework that unifies network reconnaissance and web application vulnerability assessment using Nmap and OWASP ZAP. The Django backend orchestrates scans via REST APIs; the Next.js frontend provides a modern dashboard for live progress, results, and reporting. A proactive reporting system enables creation of individual and comprehensive reports with governance via audit logs. We describe system architecture, methods, implementation, evaluation, limitations, and future work.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background to the Study
Cybersecurity assessments often require both network reconnaissance and web application testing. Practitioners pivot across tools (e.g., Nmap, ZAP), causing operational friction, inconsistent reporting, and limited governance. This study proposes PEN-T, a unified orchestration and reporting framework to improve efficiency, repeatability, and auditability.

1.2 Statement of the Problem
- Fragmented workflows across network and application layers
- Lack of unified progress tracking and consolidated results
- Limited proactive reporting and governance (audit logs)
- Barriers to automation and CI/CD integration

1.3 Aim and Objectives of the Study
Aim: To design and implement a unified penetration testing framework integrating Nmap and ZAP with proactive reporting.
Objectives:
- Design a RESTful backend to orchestrate scans and manage reports/audit logs.
- Implement a modern frontend for real-time monitoring and visualization.
- Integrate Nmap for port scanning and ZAP for vulnerability assessment.
- Provide proactive report prompts and comprehensive report generation.
- Evaluate performance, usability, and reliability.

1.4 Methodology
1.4.1 Integrate and parameterize Nmap and OWASP ZAP services for security scanning
1.4.2 Design the reporting/audit database schema for scan results and logs
1.4.3 Develop a real-time web application (Next.js + Django) for orchestration and visualization
1.4.4 Implement and test the web-based system with representative targets

1.5 Scope of the Study
PEN-T covers single-target port scans, ZAP-driven vulnerability scans, comprehensive scans, proactive reporting, and audit logs. Multi-target scheduling and advanced scan policies are future work.

1.6 Significance of the Study
Provides unified, auditable security scanning with streamlined reporting to reduce operational friction and improve repeatability.

1.7 Justification for the Study
Combining Nmap and ZAP in one workflow with governance and reporting meets a practical need in security operations and education.

1.8 Motivation for the Study
Simplify practitioner workflows and support reproducible, report-driven assessments for organizations and students.

1.10 Operation Definition of Terms
- Port Scan: Network probing to identify open ports/services.
- Vulnerability Scan: Automated testing to detect web application weaknesses.
- Audit Log: Record of system events including actor, action, and metadata.
